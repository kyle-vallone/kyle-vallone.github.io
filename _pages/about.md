## Work Experience
#### Volunteer Curriculum Designer | Aspirnaut (Vanderbilt University Medical Center) | May 2023 - Present 
* Developing a combined suite of lecture and lab activities to bring state-of-the-art chemical biology research to rural high school classrooms
* Facilitating student research projects into the mechanisms of diabetic kidney disease using invertebrate model organisms
* Supporting the rollout of a three-year pilot program in Wynne, Arkansas (starting in October 2023) and working with administrators to develop a state-approved course pathway
* Assessing program impacts and efficacy through the lens of science self-efficacy, identity, and belonging
* Designed new classroom space to house lecture, lab, and community outreach activities in response to tornado damage at the original site
#### Undergraduate Researcher | Patton Lab (Vanderbilt University) | August 2022 - Present
* Investigating retinal regeneration in zebrafish through the lens of inflammation-senescence dynamics
* Employing techniques such as immunohistochemistry and RNASeq to quantifiably assess the roles of different signaling pathways in regeneration
#### Student Consultant in Molecular Biology | Open Avenues/Foghorn Therapeutics | June - August 2022
* Developed a molecular cloning strategy in order to constitutively express a gene of interest (SMARCA4) in the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex
* Used SnapGene to design a plasmid vector containing SMARCA4 fused with a nuclear localization sequence and GFP and FLAG tags to study the nuclear expression of this gene
* Assessed gene of interest's association with cancer and determined if the gene or its resulting proteins would be suitable for targeting with therapeutic solutions.
* Researched druggability of multiple biomarkers in the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex
#### Founder and Lead Organizer | Operation CAPO CARES | March - June 2020
* Founded CAPO CARES as a school district-wide initiative to respond to COVID-19 personal protective equipment shortages, producing over 12,000 components in three months for hospitals in need
* Planned logistics to distribute 40 idle 3D printers for students to print face shield components from home
* Personally advocated for and coordinated $5,000 donation from Dell Technologies
* Inspired additional schools and robotics teams to follow our example via media interviews and coverage
