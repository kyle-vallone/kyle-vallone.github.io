## Project Overview

## Key Features
* **Adjustable Fit:** The clamping action of the phone holder’s attachment mechanism allows it to fit handlebars ranging from 23 to 26 mm in diameter.
* **Flexible Design:** The elastic TPU that makes up the “ball” of the ball-and-socket joint allows you to easily swap between vertical and horizontal display orientations. Thanks to the four resting positions of the mount, you can even face your screen away from you to avoid distractions while riding!
* **Quick Swap Functionality:** The flexible case attached to the mount allows you to quickly swap your phone from its normal housing to the holder in mere seconds. This works perfectly if you’re already using my MagSafe-equipped 3D-printed phone case design, as it’s the same fit.
* **Durability:** Made from UV-resistant and durable ABS and TPU, this mount is built to stand the test of time, all the while protecting your phone on the way.

## Design Philosophy 
Top-down modeling was leveraged to create the bulk of this design.

## Assembly Instructions
1. Add M5 heat-set threaded inserts to the holes on the non-socket side of the top clamp part.
2. Press the ball end of the arm piece into the socket end of the top clamp part.
3. Fit the phone case adapter piece over the end of the arm. Line up the holes on each part and secure them together with a M5 x 20 mm bolt and M5 nut.
4. Fit the top and bottom clamp parts over your handlebars. Slot M5 x 10 mm socket head bolts into the holes on the bottom part of the clamp. Use a hex key to screw both bolts through the heat set inserts on the other side of the clamp until the mount fits snuggly on the handlebars.
5. Slide your phone into the phone case on the mount and adjust the arm to the desired orientation (vertical or horizontal). Rest the arm in one of the slots on the socket end below the retaining nubs to ensure the phone is secure within the mount. Happy riding!
