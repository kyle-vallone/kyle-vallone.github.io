## Project Overview
This project endeavored to use two different 3D printing technologies to create components for an electric longboard. 
* Selective laser sintering (SLS) was used to produce longboard trucks with an integrated motor mount for the longboard. To design these trucks, generative design was leveraged to generate outcomes that uniquely fit the loads and constraints specific to this use case while minimizing the mass of material produced. Due to the flexibility of the generative design workflow, outcomes were generated to fit two materials: Nylon 12 (printed on a Formlabs Fuse 1) and AlSi10Mg (an aluminum alloy).
* Large format fused filament fabrication (FFF) printing was used to create the longboard deck. As the printed longboard is heavier than conventionally manufactured decks, a ["short longboard" style](https://vandemlongboardshop.co.uk/collections/short-longboards) was chosen to minimize the weight and size of the overall assembly to make it easier to carry around for everyday use cases. This short longboard style also lends itself to an agile riding style due to the smaller turn radius of the wheelbase.
