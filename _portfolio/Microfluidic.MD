## Project Overview
Microfluidic devices allow us to manipulate small amounts of fluid, which provides the opportunity to limit solution use, therefore increasing workflow efficiency. Whether their use translates to requiring lower sample volumes in medical applications or saving on reagent/ingredient costs in industrial and research applications to reduce waste, microfluidics are becoming increasingly common as our society moves on to nanoscale levels of innovation. However, when dealing with microscale volumes, a lack of turbulent flow can become an issue, as it limits mixing between different fluids. For that reason, microfluidic systems often require mixing elements to disrupt laminar flow, allowing fluids to mix into a homogenous solution before they are passed along to other devices.
